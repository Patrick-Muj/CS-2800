		<p>Elements of design such as Color, Texture, Size, Space and Shape are great for engagement and make the site look nice , some businesses go overboard with the color. Their sites are crowded with a lot of color and Some people may  think that it’s great but it can become overwhelming if there are too many so it's important to choose the right colors. Different colors produce different emotions in people,</p>
        
        <h2>Interaction</h2>
